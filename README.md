# TEC-CodeGen
GUI BASED IMPLEMENTATION OF LED MATRIX (CODE GENERATOR)
ABSTRACT
This mini project uses visual studio and c# to enable the user to type a string to have the code generated for it to be displayed in a 8 x 8 LED MATRIX. The code is compiled using Atmel and burned into Atmega32A microcontroller using Extreme Burner. The user can also specify which LEDâ€™s to glow as a pattern and have the desired output displayed on LED Matrix.
Problem
Coding avr microcontroller using embedded C can be intimidating sometimes for Electronics engineers and other developers. This Code generator will generate the code for any pattern for most LED matrices available commercially.
Environment
Microsoft Visual Studio 2013(Project style: Windows Forms Application)
Atmel Studio 2010(Project style: GCC C Executable Project)
